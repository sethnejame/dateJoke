# Joke & Date Website Exercise
### Colloqially known as the greatest website ever created

Per Faraz's specs, the attached website contains two buttons:

1. One button, when pressed, displays today's date, formatted
2. The other button, when pressed, displays a random joke from an array

The website can be viewed in your browser by visiting https://sethnejame.github.io/dateJoke
